# A module to control [Livemind Recorder v0.9.4.0](https://livemind.tv/recorder)

Livemind Recorder is a desktop application letting you monitor and record up to 16 NDIÂ® sources, utilizing NewTek's latest NDI 4.5 recording capabilities. App features configurable multiview with multiple layouts, tally borders, VU-meters, audio monitoring, and available storage indicators.

## Configuration

Livemind Record offers an API through a simple TCP interface to control its operation. Companion can run on the same or a separate machine from Recorder.

- In **Recorder**, connections are accepted on a port selected in the Settings dialog (`9099` by default ). Please make sure the port is set and the checkbox is enabled. 
  
  _**Note**: You may have to confgure this port in your operating system's firewall to allow Recorder to recieve connections from other devices on your network. The machine where Companion is running will also need this port configured to allow traffic.]_
- In **Companion**: Add the module to your setup and fill in the following setup parameters:

  - **IP ADDRESS**: This is the IP address of the machine running Livemind Recorder. If you are running on the same computer as Companion you may use `127.0.0.1` otherwise enter a valid IPv4 address in the same subnet. (Default: `127.0.0.1`)

  - **PORT**: This is the TCP API port where Recorder is listenting for commands. This needs to match the port set in the Recorder settings dialog. (Default: `9099`)

  - **Number of Slots to Create**: Select the number of slots to create based off of the grid layout you are using Recorder. This should match the Grid Size setting in Recorder settings. Options: `(2x2, 3x2, 3x3, 4x3, 4x4, 2+8, 2+14)`

  - **Verbose Debug to Log**: Check this box to include verbose debug messages in the Companion log tab. Verbose will show the command and response from the API.

### Notes
- It is reccomended to `disable` any instances of the Recorder module in Companion if the Recorder application is not open and running on the target computer. If the application is not open Companion will coninuously try to connect to the application causing repeated errors in the logfile as well as unecessary network traffic. You can create a button that toggles `enable/disable` of any instance of the Recorder module. 
- Multiple instances of the module can be added each pointing to a different IP address to control multiple instances of Recorder.
